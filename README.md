# AnnoyMissPurr
This is your cat-annoying-simulator.

You will... annoy the hell out of this grumpy cat.

My idea came from "the useless box," a box where users will flick the switch on, and the bot in the box will flick it off. And I remember seeing a video where the box gets fed up and points a gun at the person, which gives me the idea. So, from the GIF included below, I think of annoying a target until they crash out, which is what inspired this project, "Annoy Miss Purr." You get to annoy the cat until it crashes out. My struggles would be trying to settle the cat's random reactions. The randomness kept shuffling, which had me suffer for a bit, and I asked ChatGPT for assistance on that part.
